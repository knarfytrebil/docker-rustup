* Build a static binary

** Description

A compare between building a static binary with local rust and docker-rustup build tool.

** Note

This "Makefile" works on debian os.

Need install the packages such as "musl-tools" as the with-musl versions of dockerfiles of docker-rustup.

Need download the openssl tar package and unpack it manually.
